# ThreeJS with React
## React Three Fiber, Drei, Cannon

This project is currently a testing ground for features to be used for my personal/portfolio website:

- Animating meshes with useFrame
  - Using Events such as onClick and onPointerOver for interactivity
- Scrolling the 3D Canvas horizontally
- Using React components within a 3D ThreeJS Canvas
- Creating meshes declaratively, using states to change mesh properties
- Lighting scenes


I have also tested and/or explored:
- standalone ThreeJS
- React Three Spring
- React Three Flex
