Things. to do:
Compartmentalise Lighting and meshes/Scene1
Look into Scroll Control- Orbit Controls do not affect scrolling velocity. (Camera always moves in the direction of Lightblue cube to Lightsalmon cube)

Create and move the NavBar into the canvas
Test fetching data in the canvas
Create a footer
Perhaps Two 100vh pages, A scene Per Page

Test. 2
Create a css grid of 4 components
onClick
    Create a 3d object in that component
    Center 3d object at center of component
    Use r3cannon api.impulse 0, 0, 2 (or another library?)

Page. Ideas Draft
Page 1 - slowly rotating bonfire from DS
Page 2
- Droika text CI/CD
- Made from grouped block "bricks", some of which can be pushed over
Page 3 - normal React page

One scroll should scroll whole page
Little dot marker showing how many pages
